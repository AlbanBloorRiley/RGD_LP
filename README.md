Implementations of the Lift and Projection method for solving the Least Squares Parameterised Inverse Eigenvalue Problem (LSPIEP), as discussed in the paper cited below, including the original formulation by Chen and Chu. As well as examples, including a Toeplitz LSPIEP and problems formed from inelastic neutron scattering experiments.

Please see the Examples file for examples.
